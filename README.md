# Batalja Spaciale 2v2 Bot

## Introduction

Welcome to my Batalja Spaciale 2v2 Bot repository!
This repository is dedicated to the development of my bot for the Batalja Spaciale game,
a coding competition infused with fun organized by our esteemed professors, 
Domen Vake and dr. Aleksandar Tošić. Here, you can explore the evolution of my bot, 
as well as the experimentation and strategies I'm implementing. 

To facilitate testing, I've included all the necessary resources for running not 
only my bot but also the Batalja Spaciale multiplayer game. Whether you're interested 
in trying out my bot or the game itself, you'll find everything you need right here. 
Feel free to navigate through the development process and dive into the code.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Before running the game, make sure you have the following:
- Default JDK (Java Development Kit)

### Running the Game

Before running the game script, make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x test.sh
```
Now, you can run the game script:
```bash
./test.sh
```
Please make sure the default JDK is installed on your system for successful execution.

## Bot Development
The main idea behind this project is to have fun and learn something new. 
I decided to develop this bot by implementing my own simplified Artificial Neural 
Network (ANN) and training it with a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The goal is to use
the ANN to score the planets in the game based on various attributes. Hopefully, 
it will learn to score the planets in a reasonable way. After scoring the planets 
with the help of the ANN, there will be additional hardcoded logic guiding further 
decisions of the bot, such as determining the right time to attack a planet or when 
to defend.
