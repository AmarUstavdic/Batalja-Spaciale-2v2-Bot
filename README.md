# Batalja Spaciale 2v2 Bot

## Introduction

Welcome to my Batalja Spaciale 2v2 Bot repository! 

This repository is dedicated to the development of my bot for the Batalja Spaciale game, a coding competition infused with fun organized by our esteemed professors, Domen Vake and dr. Aleksandar Tošić. Here, you can explore the evolution of my bot, as well as the experimentation and strategies I'm implementing. To facilitate testing, I've included all the necessary resources for running not only my bot but also the Batalja Spaciale multiplayer game. Whether you're interested in trying out my bot or the game itself, you'll find everything you need right here. Feel free to navigate through the development process and dive into the code.

## Running the Game
